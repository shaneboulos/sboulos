# sboulos.dev — Personal Development Workspace

This is my home base for learning, practicing, and building as I transition into AI-assisted development, automation, and modern web workflows.

I'm documenting my progress publicly as I develop skills in:
- Modern frontend tooling  
- AI-assisted engineering  
- Automation and workflow design  
- Practical Linux and macOS development environments  
- Shopify and Klaviyo technical foundations

This repository will evolve as my capabilities grow. Early steps will include:
- Setting up a clean development environment  
- Learning Git and version control  
- Building my personal site with Astro  
- Creating small automations and integrations  
- Publishing what I learn along the way  

This is a starting point, not a finished product — the goal is steady progress.
